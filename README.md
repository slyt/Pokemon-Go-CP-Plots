# Plotting Pokemon Max Combat Power 
This notebook contains nine different iterations of plots in an attempt to visualize a Pokemon's max Combat Power (CP) in [Pokemon GO](https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/). CP represents a Pokemon's ability to perform well in battle, a higher CP generally means a Pokemon will be a better fighter. CP is calculated from a Pokemon's base stats: Attack, Defence, and Stamina (somtimes called HP). As a Pokemon levels up, it's base stats increase and as a result Combat Power also increases.

Example output:

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Open CV](https://opencv.org/about/)
- [color spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space)
- [json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
